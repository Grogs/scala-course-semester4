# Lesson 8

Start by checking out the `lesson8` branch

This week we want to allow the user to check the price of each hotel.
  
Steps:

We will create a new endpoint which will allow us to check the price of a hotel, and this endpoint will be called from the view to check each price.

Part A - Add endpoint for individual prices
1. Create a method that will allow you to get the price in `HotelPriceService`
2. Add the new endpoint in `HotelsController` and add a route
3. Add a link to the new endpoint per hotel, so it can be checked individually
4. Modify the link to be a button that displays the price in a modal window


Part B - Include all prices on table
